The MPSGaze dataset is a synthetic dataset containing full images (instead of only cropped faces) that provides ground truth 3D gaze directions for multiple people in one image.

## Method

We propose the first one-stage end-to-end gaze estimation method, GazeOnce, which is capable of simultaneously predicting gaze directions for multiple faces (>10) in an image. The overview of our method and an example of our output are shown below.
